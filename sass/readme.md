// POG Pattern Library

Structure:

Assets: obvious
Partials: Modules of functionality. e.g. Nav bar. A Nav bar file will include, within the file, the mixing used by that module.
Utilities: obvious
main.scss contains includes only
base.scss contains only the basic default styles for basic elements without classes etc. We talk to the DOM classes in each module.
